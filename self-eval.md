# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I felt okay for the first 3 challenges. I got stuck on the last challenge because I was unsure how to use for statements to make the age property increase by 1.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow is great. I take breaks when I need them and I'm able to enter flow state every time I come back to my work.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I need to enter study hall more and collaborate more with my classmates so that we can work through difficult problems together like the last challenge of this assignment.
